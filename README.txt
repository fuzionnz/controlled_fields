Controlled Fields Module


INTRODUCTION
=============

The Controlled Fields module adds in rudimentary control of field visibility on form displays whilst also handling whether a field is required or not. It currently only supports the field of type 'list_string' for the controlling field.

Field visibility is set on the form display using the field settings form and is achieved by setting the 'Parent conditional controlling field' and a corresponding 'Parent conditional controlling field value'.

Handling of the required setting validation is done by shifting the setting value to third party settings so as not to interfere with entity validation.


REQUIREMENTS
============

No special requirements.
